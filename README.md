# BackgroundWeatherApp
This is a creative minimally desigined Weather App. 
I have used React.js as the Front-End Framework and Open Weather API for Weather Reports that are rendered dynamically.It also has a complex logic which reads the weather and renders a background image accordingly from the assets folder.
It was fun making this simple Weather App.

You can watch the video of the working App on my LinkedIn profile @Kush Munot.
